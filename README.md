1. By parboiling the rice, the Biryani can be steamed instead of boiled. 
2. This renders the chicken tender and juicy.
3. The ingredients required for this are
   1. 3 table spoons yogurt
   2. one table spoon garam masala
   3. half tea spoon salt

* one table spoon lemon juice
* serve it in the plate
