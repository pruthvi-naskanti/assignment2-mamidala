# ITS MY FAVORITE DISH
1. By parboiling the rice, the Biryani can be steamed instead of boiled. 
2. This renders the chicken tender and juicy.
3. The ingredients required for this are
   1. 3 table spoons yogurt
   2. one table spoon garam masala
   3. half tea spoon salt

* one table spoon lemon juice
* serve it in the plate
